## About Me

I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Computer Science Department at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Yizhou Yu (ACM & IEEE Fellow). Before that, I received both the B.Eng. degree and the M.Eng. degree from Sun Yat-sen University, advised by Prof. Guanbin Li. Currently, my research interests include weakly supervised learning, dataset condensation and embodied AI.
